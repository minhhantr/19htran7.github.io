        <h1>Welcome to my resume!!</h1>
        <p>I was born in Vietnam, but I moved here since May 18th, 2016 which is approximately<br>
        one year and a half ago. What I've achieved over a year that I'm about to list now is also<br>
        what I've achieved since I came to the US. First, I had 8 classes last year and I got straight<br>
        A's - 4.0 GPA. Secondly, I became VSA's co-secretary, and I participated in every event of VSA <br>
        last year. Thirdly, I received most-improved award in my choir class and I also got into Vocal <br>
        Ensemble of La Quinta High School. Lastly, I was invited to the Principal's Lunch by Ms.Lewis.<br>
        I'm still trying to develop myself, explore more in my abilities and improve my weaknesses.</p>

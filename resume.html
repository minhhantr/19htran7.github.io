        <h1>Welcome to my resume!!</h1>
        <p>I was born in Vietnam, but I moved here since May 18th, 2016 which is approximately<br>
        one year and a half ago. What I've achieved over a year that I'm about to list now is also<br>
        what I've achieved since I came to the US. First, I had 8 classes last year and I got straight<br>
        A's in 7 classes, but I got a B+ 89.95% in the other one class. I got 3.92 GPA last year.<br>
        Secondly, I became VSA's co-secretary, and I volunteered in every events of VSA last year. Thirdly,<br>
        I received most-improved award in my choir class and I also got into Vocal Ensemble of La Quinta<br>
        High School. Lastly, I was invited to the Principal's Lunch by Ms.Lewis. I'm still trying to develop<br>
        myself, explore more in my abilities and improve my weaknesses.</p>
